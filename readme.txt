If you have a custom login form other than wp-login.php then we will provide you the shortcode. Shortcode will work only for the customized login page created from wordpress plugins. We are not claiming that it will work with all the customized login page. In such case, custom work is needed to integrate two factor with your customized login page. You can submit a query in our <b>Support Section</b> in the plugin or you can contact us at info@miniorange.com for more details.

= I have installed plugins which limit the login attempts like Limit Login Attempt, Loginizer, Wordfence etc. Is there any incompatibilities with these kind of plugins? =

The limit login attempt kind of plugins limit the number of login attempts and block the IP temporarily. So if you are using 2 factor along with these kind of plugins then you should increase the login attempts (minimum 5) so that you dont get locked out yourself.
